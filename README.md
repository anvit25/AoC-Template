#AoC-Template

A template package to automatically get input files for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

### How to use
You need to do two things to set up this tool
* Set the `YEAR` variable in `src\get_input.py`
* Set the `COOKIE` variable in `src\get_input.py`. I have used System Environment variables, but you may hardcode. 

You can obtain your cookie by logging in to Advent of Code and getting the `session` cookie (In Firefox, Right-click, Inspect and then Storage Tab)
